Let's analyze the code:

A dictionary Dict is initialized.
Three key-value pairs are added to the dictionary:
Key (1, 2, 4) with value 8
Key (4, 2, 1) with value 10
Key (1, 2) with value 12
A loop iterates over each key in the dictionary, and the values corresponding to each key are added to the variable sum_.
The length of the dictionary (len(Dict)) is added to the sum of the values (sum_).
The result is printed.
Let's calculate:

Length of the dictionary Dict: 3
Sum of values in the dictionary: 8 + 10 + 12 = 30
Length of the dictionary plus sum of values: 3 + 30 = 33
So, the correct answer is B) 33.
