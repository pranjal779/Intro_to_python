```py
L = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
res = ''.join(L)
print(res)
```

# What will be the output?
# A. [abcd]
# B. a"b"c"d"
# C. abcd
# E. Error

I'll explain the code and its output:

**Code Breakdown:**

1. `L = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']`: This line creates a list named `L` and assigns it the values `'a'`, `'b'`, `'c'`, and `'d'`. So, `L` becomes a list of characters.

2. `res = ''.join(L)`: This line uses the `join` method. The `join` method takes an iterable (like a list) and a separator (an empty string `''` in this case) as arguments. It joins the elements of the iterable with the separator and returns a new string. Here, it joins the characters in `L` with no separator (empty string), effectively concatenating them into a single string. The result is stored in the variable `res`.

3. `print(res)`: This line simply prints the value of `res` to the console.

**Output:**

The output of this code will be:

```
abcd
```

**Explanation:**

- The `join` method with an empty string separator combines the characters in `L` without any spaces or delimiters, resulting in the string `'abcd'`.
- The `print` statement displays this string to the console.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C. abcd**.
