"""
(Challenge Project: Reimplement DataFrame Output) You saw that pandas displays
DataFrames in an attractive column-based format with row and column labels. The values
within each column are right aligned in the same field width, which is determined by that
columnâ€™s widest value. To understand how powerful it is to have this formatting built-in,
write a function that reimplements DataFrame formatting using loops. Assume the DataFrame contains only positive integer values and that both the row and column labels are
each integer values beginning at 0
